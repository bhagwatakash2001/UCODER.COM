          <p class="mt-3"> <strong> 1. First generation 1945 – 1955 - </strong>
            The earliest electronic digital computers had no operating systems.
            Machines of the time were so primitive that programs were often
            entered one bit at time on rows of mechanical switches (plug boards).
            Programming languages were unknown (not even assembly
            languages).</p>


          <p class="mt-3"> <strong>2.Second generation 1955 – 1965 - </strong>

            By the early 1950's, the routine had improved somewhat with the
            introduction of punch cards.
            The General Motors Research Laboratories implemented the first
            operating systems in early 1950's for their IBM 701. The system of
            the 50's generally ran one job at a time. These were called singlestream
            batch processing systems because programs and data were
            submitted in groups or batches.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-3"> <strong> 3. Third generation 1965 – 1980 - </strong>

            The systems of the 1960's were also batch processing systems, but
            they were able to take better advantage of the computer's resources by
            running several jobs at once. So operating systems designers
            developed the concept of multiprogramming in which several jobs are
            in main memory at once; a processor is switched from job to job as
            needed to keep several jobs advancing while keeping the peripheral
            devices in use.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-3"> <strong> 4. Fourth generation 1980 –</strong>

            With the development of LSI (Large Scale Integration) circuits,
            chips, operating system entered in the system entered in the personal
            computer and the workstation age. Microprocessor technology
            evolved to the point that it becomes possible to build desktop
            computers as powerful as the mainframes of the 1970s.

          <p>The users of a batch operating system do not interact with the computer directly. Each user prepares his
            job on an off-line device like punch cards and submits it to the computer operator. <br>

            <img src="/img/os-batch.jpg" class="img-fluid mb-4 mt-3 " alt="Responsive image"
              style="border-right: 2px solid dodgerblue;border-bottom: 2px solid dodgerblue;"> <br>

            To speed up processing,jobs with similar needs are batched together and run as a group. The programmers
            leave their programs with
            the operator and the operator then sorts the programs with similar requirements into batches.
          </p>
          <b>The problems with Batch Systems are as follows −</b>
          <ul class="mt-3">
            <li class="mt-1"><u>1) Lack of interaction between the user and the job.</u></li>
            <li class="mt-1"><u> 2) CPU is often idle, because the speed of the mechanical I/O devices is slower than
                the CPU.</u>
            </li>
            <li class="mt-1"><u>3) Difficult to provide the desired priority</u></li>

          <p>1. In this the operating system picks up and begins to execute one of the jobs from memory. <br><br>

            2. Once this job needs an I/O operation operating system switches to another job (CPU and OS always busy).

            <br><br> 3. Jobs in the memory are always less than the number of jobs on disk(Job Pool). <br><br>

            4. If several jobs are ready to run at the same time, then the system chooses which one to run through the
            process of CPU Scheduling.
            <br><br>
            5. In Non-multiprogrammed system, there are moments when CPU sits idle and does not do any work.
            In Multiprogramming system, CPU will never be idle and keeps on processing.

          <b>1.Hard Real Time- systems -</b>
          <p>Hard real-time systems guarantee that critical tasks complete on time. In hard real-time systems, secondary
            storage is limited or missing and the data is stored in ROM. In these systems, virtual memory is almost
            never found.</p>

          <b>2.Soft Real Time- systems -</b>
          <p>Soft real-time systems are less restrictive. A critical real-time task gets priority over other tasks and
            retains the priority until it completes. Soft real-time systems have limited utility than hard real-time
            systems. For example, multimedia, virtual reality, Advanced Scientific Projects like undersea exploration
            and planetary rovers, etc</p>

          <h5>Time Sharing Operating System</h5>




          <img src="/img/os-timesharing.png" class="img-fluid mb-4 mt-3 pt-2 pb-2 " alt="Responsive image"

          <p>1.Time-sharing is a technique which enables many people, located at various terminals, to use a particular
            computer system at the same time. Time-sharing or multitasking is a logical extension of multiprogramming.
            Processor's time which is shared among multiple users simultaneously is termed as time-sharing.
            <br><br>

            2.The main difference between Multiprogrammed Batch Systems and Time-Sharing Systems is that in case of
            Multiprogrammed batch systems, the objective is to maximize processor use, whereas in Time-Sharing Systems,
            the objective is to minimize response time.
            <br><br>

            3.Multiple jobs are executed by the CPU by switching between them, but the switches occur so frequently.
            Thus,
            the user can receive an immediate response. For example, in a transaction processing, the processor executes
            each user program in a short burst or quantum of computation. That is, if n users are present, then each
            user can get a time quantum. When the user submits the command, the response time is in few seconds at most.

            <li class="mt-1"><u>Process management</u></li>

          </ul>

          <h5>Process Management</h5>
          <p>The operating system manages many kinds of activities ranging from user programs to
            system programs like printer spooler, name servers, file server etc. <br> Each of these activities
            is encapsulated in a process. A process includes the complete execution context (code,
            data, PC, registers, OS resources in use etc.). The basic unit of software that the operating
            system deals with in scheduling the work done by the processor is either a process or a
            thread, depending on the operating system. <br><br> It’s tempting to think of a process as an
            application, but that gives an incomplete picture of how processes relate to the operating system and
            hardware. <br> The application you see (word processor or spreadsheet or game) is,
            indeed, a process, but that application may cause several other processes to begin, for tasks
            like communications with other devices or other computers. There are also numerous
            processes that run without giving you direct evidence that they ever exist. A process, then,
            is software that performs some action and can be controlled by a user, by other applications
            or by the operating system. <br><br> It is processes, rather than applications, that the operating
            system controls and schedules for execution by the CPU. In a single-tasking system, the
            schedule is straightforward. The operating system allows the application to begin running,
            suspending the execution only long enough to deal with interrupts and user input.</p>

          <h6>The five major activities of an operating system in regard to process management are -</h6>
          <ul class="mt-3 mb-3">
            <li class="mt-1"><u> Suspension and resumption of processes.</u></li>
            <li class="mt-1"><u> A mechanism for process synchronization.</u></li>

            <li class="mt-1"><u> Creation and deletion of user and system processes.</u></li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Main-Memory Management</h5>
          <p>Services provided under Memory Management are directed to keeping track of memory
            and allocating/de allocating it to various processes.
            <br> The OS keeps a list of free memory
            locations. Before a program is loaded in the memory from the disk, this MM consults the
            free list, allocates the memory to the process, depending upon the program size and
            updates the list of free memory. Primary-Memory or Main-Memory is a large array of
            words or bytes. Each word or byte has its own address. Main-memory provides storage
            that can be access directly by the CPU. That is to say for a program to be executed, it must
            in the main memory.
          </p>

          <h6>The major activities of an operating in regard to memory-management are -</h6>

          <ul class="mt-3 mb-3">
            <li class="mt-1">Keeping track of which parts of memory are currently being used and by whom.</li>

            <li class="mt-1"> Allocating and deallocating memory space as needed.</li>

          </ul>


          <h5>File Management</h5>
          <p>A file is a collected of related information defined by its creator. Computer can store files
            on the disk (secondary storage), which provide long term storage. Some examples of
            storage media are magnetic tape, magnetic disk and optical disk. <br><br> Each of these media has
            its own properties like speed, capacity, and data transfer rate and access methods. <br> A file
            system normally organized into directories to ease their use. <br> These directories may contain
            files and other directions.

            are -</h6>

          </ul>


          <h5>I/O Device Management</h5>
          <p>Input / Output device management provides an environment for the better interaction
            between system and the I / O devices. To interact with I/O devices in an effective manner,
            the operating system uses some special programs known as device driver.
            <br>
            <br> The device drivers take the data that operating system has defined as a file and then translate them
            into
            streams of bits or a series of laser pulses.
            <br> The device driver is a specialized hardware
            dependent computer program that enables another program, typically an operating system
            to interact transparently with a hardware device, and usually provides the required interrupt
            handling necessary for the time dependent hardware interfacing.

          </p>

          <h6> The I/O subsystem consists of several components -</h6>

          <ul class="mt-3 mb-3">
            <li class="mt-1"><u> A memory management component that includes buffering, caching, spooling</u></li>
            <li class="mt-1"><u>A general device driver interface</u></li>
            <li class="mt-1"><u> Drivers for specific hardware devices</u></li>
          </ul>


          <h5>Seconary Storage Management</h5>

          <p>Systems have several levels of storage, including primary storage, secondary storage and
            cache storage. Instructions and data must be placed in primary storage or cache to be
            referenced by a running program.
            <br>
            <br> Because main memory is too small to accommodate all
            data and programs, and its data are lost when power is lost, the computer system must
            provide secondary storage to back up main memory.
            <br> Secondary storage consists of tapes,
            disks, and other media designed to hold information that will eventually be accessed in
            primary storage (primary, secondary, cache) is ordinarily divided into bytes or words
            consisting of a fixed number of bytes.
            <br> Each location in storage has an address; the set of all
            addresses available to a program is called an address space.

            which different applications and programs can do useful work.
          </p>
          <p>The major operations of the operating system are process management, memory management, device management
            and file management. These are given in detail as follows:</p>

            Process Management</h6>
          <p>The operating system is responsible for managing the processes i.e assigning the processor to a process at
            a time. This is known as process scheduling. The different algorithms used for process scheduling are FCFS
            (first come first served), SJF (shortest job first), priority scheduling, round robin scheduling etc.
            <br><br>

            There are many scheduling queues that are used to handle processes in process management. When the processes
            enter the system, they are put into the job queue. The processes that are ready to execute in the main
            memory are kept in the ready queue. The processes that are waiting for the I/O device are kept in the device
            queue.
          </p>

          <p>Memory management plays an important part in operating system. It deals with memory and the moving of
            processes from disk to primary memory for execution and back again.

          </p>

          The activities performed by the operating system for memory management are:

          <h6 style="border-left: 4px solid tomato;line-height: 2.1em; background-color:#f7f7f7; padding-left: .5em;">
            Device Management</h6>

          <p>There are many I/O devices handled by the operating system such as mouse, keyboard, disk drive etc.
            <br> There
            are different device drivers that can be connected to the operating system to handle a specific device. The
            device controller is an interface between the device and the device driver. The user applications can access
            all the I/O devices using the device drivers, which are device specific codes.

          </p>
          <h6 style="border-left: 4px solid tomato;line-height: 2.1em; background-color:#f7f7f7; padding-left: .5em;">
            File Management</h6>
          <p>Files are used to provide a uniform view of data storage by the operating system. All the files are mapped
            onto physical devices that are usually non volatile so data is safe in the case of system failure.

            <br> The files can be accessed by the system in two ways i.e. sequential access and direct access
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h6>Sequential Access</h6>
              <p>
                The information in a file is processed in order using sequential access. The files records are accessed
                on after another. Most of the file systems such as editors, compilers etc. use sequential access.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h6>Direct Access</h6>
              <p>
                In direct access or relative access, the files can be accessed in random for read and write operations.
                The direct access model is based on the disk model of a file, since it allows random accesses.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>


          <h4 style="border-bottom: 1px solid tomato;line-height: 2.1em; padding-left: .5em;">Program Management</h4>
          <p>
            Program Manager contains all the executable files of every application and program present in the computer,
            and
            is placed in the root directory of system.
            <br>
          </p>

          <h4 style="border-bottom: 1px solid tomato;line-height: 2.1em; padding-left: .5em;">Resource Management</h4>

          <p>Internally an Operating System acts as a manager of resources of the computer system such as processor,
            memory, files, and I/O device.
            <br>


            <img src="/img/os-parts.png" class="img-fluid mt-2 mb-2 " alt="Responsive image"> <br>


            In this role, the operating system keeps track of the status of each resource, and decides who gets a
            resource, for how long and when.
            In system that supports concurrent execution of program, the operating system resolves conflicting requests
            for resources in manner that preserves system integrity, and in doing so attempts to optimize the resulting
            performance.
          </p>

          <h4 style="border-bottom: 1px solid tomato;line-height: 2.1em; padding-left: .5em;">Security and protection
          </h4>
          <p>Security refers to providing a protection system to computer system resources such as CPU, memory, disk,
            software programs and most importantly data/information stored in the computer system.
            <br> If a computer program
            is run by an unauthorized user, then he/she may cause severe damage to computer or data stored in it. So a
            computer system must be protected against unauthorized access, malicious access to system memory, viruses,
            worms etc.

          <p> We'll make a basic Operating System in C#, don't worry, if you even know some basics of c++ or
            java,
            you'll understand the code.
            <hr>

            By end of this tutorial, you'll be able to make your cool operating system!
          </p>

          <img src="/img/osy-p.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"><br><br>

          <div class="container bg-light" style="margin-left:-10px;">
            <strong class="text-dark">Step 1 The Concept</strong>
          </div>
          <p class="mt-2">So, how actually a OS works? I'll explain from the level of a electric circuit.
            <br>

            Most of you know logic gates in electric circuits. when many logic gates are connected, i.e.
            billions of
            transistors are connected together inside a chip, they can store 0s and 1s. Each gate could
            store either
            0 or 1.

            Then the connected transistor forms a Micro-Controller or a Micro-Processor. Here we are going
            to
            program on the micro-processor which is in your computer.
            <br><br>

            Did you know that your computer can also run with a operating system!? Wonder how! Every chip in
            your
            computer can run individually without a microprocessor but then without OS, it can't do multi
            tasking or
            run multiple threads together like in simple words, play a video in which one time music can
            play and
            one time graphics can play. But both can't run together.
            <br><br>

            Because of an operating system, today you can listen to music while browsing the internet.

            The OS works based on its kernel. The kernel stores all the library files and whenever we run a
            program,
            the program's code calls header files from the kernel. In windows, kernel is 'Win32'
          </p>

            <strong class="text-dark">Step 3 Introduction to COSMOS</strong>
          </div> <br>

          <p>Cosmos (C# Open Source Managed Operating System) is an operating system development kit which
            uses Visual Studio as its development environment.
            <br> Despite C# in the name, any .NET based
            language can be used including VB.NET, Fortran, Delphi Prism, IronPython, F# and more. Cosmos
            itself and the kernel routines are primarily written in C#, and thus the Cosmos name. Besides
            that, NOSMOS (.NET Open Source Managed Operating System) sounds stupid.
          </p>


          <h6>Cosmos is not an operating system in the traditional sense, but instead it is an "Operating
            System Kit", or as I like to say "Operating System Legos". </h6>

          <p>Cosmos lets you create operating systems just as Visual Studio and C# normally let you create
            applications. Most users can write
            and boot their own operating system in just a few minutes, all using Visual Studio. Milestone 5
            includes new features such as an integrated project type in Visual Studio, and an integrated
            debugger.
            <br><br> You can debug your operating system directly from Visual Studio using breakpoints.
            Cosmos is available in two distributions, the developer kit (dev kit), and the user kit. The dev
            kit is designed for users who want to work on Cosmos itself. The user kit is designed for those
            who are interested in building their own operating system and doing some Cosmos work. The dev
            kit might be thought of as the Cosmos SDK. Most users should start off with the user kit as it
            is not so overwhelming like the dev kit. This article focuses on the user kit.

            <strong class="text-dark">Step 4 Writing Your First Operating System</strong>
          </div> <br>
          <p>So, first lets write a OS which can simply print some text on screen! <br>

            For that install all of the software required that is mentioned in the previous step.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li class="mt-1">Open visual studio and navigate to File>New Project</li>
            <li class="mt-1">In the new project dialog box, select COSMOS and then COSMOS Project in the
              templates box. Name the project and click OK!</li>

          <ul>
            <li class="mt-1"> Now you'll see a file "program.cs" in the solution explorer. Click and load
              it.
            </li>
            <li class="mt-1"> You'll see a whole lot of code in it, don't be scared, we just need to edit
              code under "public static void Init()" block only</li>
          </ul>

          <img src="/img/osy-p2.png" class="img-fluid shadow mb-4 bg-white rounded" alt="Responsive image">

          <ul>
            <li class="mt-1"> Now click on start button you see on visual studio toolbar or from Debug menu,
              click "start debugging"</li>
            <li class="mt-1">You'll see a COSMOS Builder window appear, without any modification, just boot

            <strong class="text-dark">Step 5 Personalizing the OS</strong>
          </div> <br>


          <p>Now just make some simple changes in code, </p>
          under <strong> public static void Init() </strong> Change<br><br>

          <code>Console.WriteLine("Welcome! You just booted C# code. Please edit Program.cs to fit your needs");</code>
          <br> <br> to <br><br>
          <code> Console.WriteLine("Hello World! This is my first operating system");</code>

          <img src="/img/osy-p4.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto shadow mb-4 mt-5 bg-white rounded" alt="Responsive image">

          <br><br>
          <p>So, you've changed Welcome! You just booted C# code. Please edit Program.cs to fit your needs to
            Hello World! This is my first operating system. <br>

            We've just edited the text. Now lets compile the code and see the output. Perform the steps in
            previous step to compile the code. <br><br>

            <img src="/img/osy-p5.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto shadow mb-5 mt-3 bg-white rounded"
              alt="Responsive image">

            Saw that! Text has changed! you can even put your name here. Congrats! you've won half the
            battle by understanding the basics. But how about a operating system that takes input from user
            and gives user a output? Just like command line operating systems or Linux terminal.
          </p>


          <div class="container bg-light" style="margin-left:-10px;">
            <strong class="text-dark">Step 6 Making a Command Line OS</strong>
          </div> <br>

          <p>So here we'll make a command line operating system. As we saw the previous code, the code just
            writes some text on screen via <b> Console.WriteLine() </b> function. Now we will write a OS
            where the
            user gives the input and the computer processes it. <br> <br>


            <img src="/img/osy-p6.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto shadow mb-5 mt-3 bg-white rounded"
              alt="Responsive image"><br>

            So, lets make a code which prints <b> Hello User! Thanks for using this operating system! </b>
            when we
            give hello as input to the computer. <br>

            In programming, there are different kinds of loops which most of you know like If loop which
            does the action if the conditions are met. So here will will use if loop and if the input of a
            user is hello, then it will print the line we mentioned above.
          </p>
          <h6>Code : </h6>
          <blockquote class="ml-5"><code>string input;<br><br>

                        input = Console.ReadLine(); <br><br>
                        
                        if (input == "hello") <br>
                        
                        {  <br><br> Console.WriteLine("Hello User! Thanks for using this operating system!");<br><br>
                        
                        }</code></blockquote>

          <p>Here in this code, we made a string named input in which we read some data. The If loop checks
            that if the input matches the word hello, then it should print Hello User! Thanks for using this
            operating system! <br><br>

            Now lets go and execute this code!

            You can now type into the operating system now! type hello <br>

            Excited? Saw the output? <br><br>

              alt="Responsive image"> <br>

            You made your own command line OS. but how about adding many more features in this? Like if you
            type about, it tells you the info about the OS and if you type help it shows the list of
            commands? Lets do it in the next step.
          </p>



          <div class="container bg-light" style="margin-left:-10px;">
            <strong class="text-dark">Step 7 Adding More Features to Our OS</strong>
          </div> <br>

          <p>So, lets add more features like about which displays COSMOS OS 1.0 and help which displays
            <br><br>

            <em> hello - Simple OS command</em><br><br>

            <em>about - Know about OS</em><br><br>

            Similarly like the previous step, make 2 more if loops.
          </p>

          <p>In this code as you see we've made 2 more if loops. Now execute the code and type <em> <b> about.
              </b> </em> <br>
            Saw that, it displays <em><b>COSMOS OS 1.0 </b></em> and then close the window and re-execute
            the
            code and then type
            <em><b> help</b></em>. Saw that? This means everything is going good. <br><br>

            Now every OS has a option of shut down or power off. So lets add features like shutdown and
            restart.

          </div> <br>

          <p>Adding shutdown and restart feature is also extremely easy. In cosmos the code to shutdown is
            <strong>Cosmos.Sys.Deboot.ShutDown();</strong> and to restart is <br><strong>
              Cosmos.Sys.Deboot.Reboot(); </strong>

            <br><br> Now make IF loops which have input as <b> shutdown </b> and <b> restart </b>.

          <p>Now execute the code and type restart. Saw it xD! It restarted! Now type shutdown. Saw it, the
            window closed which means the OS shut down. <br><br>

            This may be the most exciting part when you made a OS which can shutdown and restart itself!

            We will also make a command that when the user types a keyword which is not in
            list of our commands, it should show No such command

          <p>Ok, just copy the code into visual studio and execute the code. Note that we added the break;.
            This is used in switch case. Now have the fun with your OS! <br><br>

            Now try to type a wrong command like help me. this command was not defined so it shows No
            command found. This means now our OS won't accept wrong commands. And try all commands. You may
            have noted that now you can type another command after previous as we are taking input in a
            constant loop.

          <p>So i'm now going to test the OS we made. I'll be using a Virtualization software to run the OS.
            I'll be using VMware player which is free to download! <br><br>

            Ok, so create a virtual machine and open C:\Users\ {Your Username} \AppData\Roaming\Cosmos User
            Kit <br><br>

            Here you will find cosmos.iso file after you select build ISO in visual studio. Just boot this
            file in VMware and enjoy your operating system! (make it full screen)
